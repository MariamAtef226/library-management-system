UPDATED:
- init_populate.sql: added admins table for authentication
- modified books schema (available_quantity to limit borrowing process)
- hate8tag te3adel el er diagram
- in config.env, change variables that are defined by ":" to "=" -- idk if it's docker related or what

FINISHED:
- Books controller (logic + validations + manual test)
-- REMAINING: Statistics bonus

- Borrowers controller (logic + validation + manual test)

- Borrowing processes controller (logic + validation + manual test)

- limit borrowing to available quantity only

TODO:
- Authentication module + adding protection to endpoints

ASSUMPTIONS:
- Available_quantity shouldn't be altered (derived only from processes of borrowing)
- Borrowers are lent books through librarians (admins) who register their borrowing process on the system - borrowers don't have access to our system
- all workers are have accounts on our system ( have entry in table admins)
- No feature can be accessed unless user is logged in
