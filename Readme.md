Bosta Library Management System is a Node.js-based application designed to help manage books and borrowers in a library setting. This system allows users to perform CRUD operations on books and borrowers, manage the borrowing process, track overdue books, and generate analytical reports. The system is built using a RESTful API architecture and utilizes a relational database system for data storage.

## Key Features 🔑

- User-friendly interface for library management 💻
- Admin panel for managing books, borrowers, and borrowing processes 🚀
- Search and listing system for books and borrowers 🔎
- Borrowing process management with due date tracking 📅
- Updates on book availability and borrowing status 🕒

Feel free to customize the content further based on your project specifics and preferences.
